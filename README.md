## BUGS

### FIXED BUGS

| Bug | Reason | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The ``automated test`` returned that some templates were not rendering correctly . | It happended because in certain scenarios templates names were wrong. | This was resolved by correctly managing the names in the templates views and ensuring proper rendering.|

I had a considerable number of problems with the result of functions in my code and also, how them were running. It happened because I was not using the correct indentation and sequence to write the functions. I revised the course content, did research on google and kept trying until I got the result that I needed. 

### UNFIXED BUGS
There is an issue with the logout functionality during the tests. The test expects a 302 status code (redirect), but it receives a 200 status code instead. This indicates that the logout view is not correctly redirecting to the login page. Despite attempts to resolve this, the issue persists.
